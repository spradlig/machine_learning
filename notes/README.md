# Notes on ML Projects
This folder holds notes that I've taken, created, or found over time. The original source is provided with the notes.

These are notes on how to execute an ML project beginning to end. They were built for a specific reason which doesn't always translate to a generically useful step-by-step package. They were not created in a manner that would lead to a single coherent tutorial. That is a project for later.
